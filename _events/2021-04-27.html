Former Mayor of Central Falls and current Senior Advisor at The Policy Lab, <a href="https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/team/james-diossa/">James Diossa</a>, will chat with Mayor Benjamin about his economic revitalization of Main Street, his tenure as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and what it's like to lead at the local level.
