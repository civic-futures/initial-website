The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive disruptions to risk-prediction models trained on longitudinal data.

Join us for a talk with <a href="https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/team/paul-xu/">Paul Xu</a>, Data Scientist at The Policy Lab during Brown's <a href="https://library.brown.edu/outreach/lovedata/">Love Data Week</a>. Paul will focus on the issue of concept drift and its effect on the model implemented in the Early Warning System (EWS), which the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) uses to predict public high school students' risks of dropping out.
