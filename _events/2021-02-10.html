Join The Policy Lab and <a href="https://library.brown.edu/outreach/lovedata/">Love Data Week</a> for a talk with <a href="https://www.brown.edu/public-health/cesh/people/jonah-popp">Jonah Popp</a>! Jonah and Brown University's Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health have developed ensembles of epidemiological models of the COVID-19 epidemic to help Rhode Island decision makers monitor the epidemic, forecast its trajectory, allocate testing and vaccination resources, and evaluate prevention and suppression policies. The models are fit daily to rich local outcome and resource-use time series curated and provided by partners including the Rhode Island Department of Health and Brown Universityâ€™s Policy Lab.
