Jen supports the Lab’s data governance infrastructure by developing, reviewing, and negotiating data sharing arrangements which meet both the requirements of project partners and Brown’s standards for the use and protection of research data. Jen consults and advises on research agreement needs for all projects from the earliest stages of development, and she signs all the resulting legal agreements on behalf of The Policy Lab and Brown University.

Jen received a law degree at New England Law | Boston and previously worked at two banks in Boston. Jen left the financial world and moved to Providence last year hoping to make a tangible contribution to Brown's creation of knowledge in pursuit of solving society's biggest challenges.
