Attiyya Houston is a Project Manager at The Policy Lab. In this role, she manages team workflows and guides progress on a range of projects. Attiyya re-joined the Lab in this role in September of 2019, having initially served as a researcher while earning her Master’s in Urban Education Policy at Brown.

During her time as a student, Attiyya developed a deep interest in the multifactorial nature of educational inequity and how that inequity implicates policies and practices across topics such as housing and health. At the same time, she worked as a program assistant with the Swearer Center on the Engaged Scholarship program. The program made her more thoughtfully consider how universities engage with communities and the pedagogy therein; it also highlighted the challenges of reimagining true community collaboration within academia.

Prior to her time at Brown, Attiyya worked as a research fellow studying microfluidics at Vanderbilt University, where she earned her bachelor’s in Biomedical Engineering. Her interest in science spurred her transition to education through afterschool and mentorship S.T.E.M. programs specifically for young girls and students of color. Outside of the lab, Attiyya enjoys listening to people excitedly discuss incredibly niche subjects, binge watching documentaries, and almost any style of dance.
