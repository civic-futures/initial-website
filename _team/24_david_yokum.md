David was previously the founding director of [The Lab @ DC](https://thelab.dc.gov/) in the D.C. Mayor’s Office and, before that, a founding member of the White House’s [Social & Behavioral Sciences Team](https://oes.gsa.gov/) and director of its scientific delivery unit housed at the U.S. General Services Administration. President Obama institutionalized the latter work in Executive Order 13707, “Using Behavioral Science Insights to Better Serve the American People.” All three ventures were exemplars of building internal-to-government scientific capacity and partnerships with universities, which have since inspired replications across the world.

David’s work — from the world’s largest field experiment of a police body-worn camera program, to building algorithms that predict the location of rats, to a Form-a-Palooza initiative systematically re-designing all government forms—has been published in diverse outlets (e.g. Nature Human Behavior, PNAS, Health Affairs, Governing Magazine) and received widespread media coverage (New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NPR, etc.). David was the founding host of [The Podcast @ DC](https://soundcloud.com/user-768286365), and he is also starting a new podcast called [30,000 Leagues](https://30000leagues.com/), which will be a forum for discussing work at the nexus of science, public policy, and life in general. His public speaking, teaching, and advocacy won the Excellence in Teaching Award from the University of Arizona.

David earned a JD/PhD (Psychology: Cognition & Neural Systems) from the University of Arizona, a Master’s degree in Bioethics & Medical Humanities from the University of South Florida, and a BS in Biology from Birmingham-Southern College. He lives in Providence, RI with his wife and two young boys.
