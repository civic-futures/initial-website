Qifan Jiang is one of two associates working directly with the Policy Lab to research the presence and availability of data scientists in State Government. She is performing this work through a scan of publicly available data sets from all 50 States which she will combine and merge. Using this new data set she will help the lab make policy recommendations to HR departments on how to better bring more data scientists into Government.

She loves Hotpot and milk tea, and what she wants to do most recently is travel to Japan.
