Before joining Brown, Seny was a researcher at Microsoft Research (Redmond Lab). His research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from privacy, security and surveillance. His primary focus is on the design and cryptanalysis of encrypted algorithms, which are efficient algorithms that operate on end-to-end encrypted data. He maintains interests in various aspects of theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data structures and algorithms, data systems, algorithmic fairness, game theory and technology policy.

Seny directs the [Encrypted Systems Lab](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University and is affiliated with the [CAPS group](http://caps.cs.brown.edu/), the [Data Science Initiative](https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/data-science/home) and the [Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Studies](https://watson.brown.edu/chrhs/).
