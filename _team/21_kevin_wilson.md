Previously, Kevin served as Principal Data Scientist of The Lab @ DC in the District of Columbia’s Executive Office of the Mayor and as Principal Data Scientist of Knewton, an education technology startup serving millions of students across the world.

At The Policy Lab, Kevin has worked with several agencies across the Rhode Island state government, helping health services understand the causes of the opioid crisis, implementing predictive models of student success at the Department of Education, and advising several agencies on data strategy.

In DC, Kevin built the District’s first secure, cloud-based compute environment, allowing The Lab @ DC to collect and analyze data from across District agencies. Using this technology, his team evaluated DC’s nurse triage line pilot, measured the effects of new police tactics and trainings, built predictive models to find rats, and much more.

In his spare time, Kevin enjoys helping young children learn about math and computers. With Microsoft’s TEALS program, Kevin started over 20 high school computer science classrooms in rural areas across the United States, reaching over 1000 students to date.
