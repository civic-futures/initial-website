Edward’s passion for public policy was sparked by his two-year service as a Military Police for the South Korean Army in between his undergraduate studies. After an on-the-ground experience with the bureaucracies of the criminal justice system and the recognition of the widespread impact these problems have on everyday citizens, he became passionate about applying the technical skills that he obtained through his study in Statistics and Computer Science at University of Chicago to the improvement of urban communities.

Prior to moving to Rhode Island to join The Policy Lab, Edward worked as a Research Assistant for the University of Chicago’s Knowledge Lab, evaluating the effectiveness of various qualitative and quantitative research methods to analyze simulated natural disaster data. He also worked for the University of Chicago’s Crime Lab, using geo-spatial data to develop features for the Lab’s predictive crime models and providing analytic support to an RCT study for a gun-violence reduction program in Chicago.

Outside the office, he can be found reading, or practicing his newfound passion for ballroom dancing.
