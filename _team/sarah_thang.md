Sarah has worked with US- and internationally-based research centers, non/intergovernmental organizations, and private corporations in areas such as behavioral science, early childhood and socio-emotional development, ed tech/blended learning and literacy, future skills readiness, and education policy. She comes to Brown from the Harvard Kennedy School, where her primary research interests included designing interventions that support teachers and improve their mental health as well as those that strengthen the socio-emotional development, learning, and perceptions of underserved student populations.

Sarah began her career as an educator at a Title 1 school where she started a Mandarin program, taught struggling readers, and supported new teachers, as well as in nonprofit management and fundraising. She holds an Ed.M. in International Education Policy from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, a B.Mus. in Music Composition/Theory, English, and Asian Studies from Vanderbilt University, and a Certificate in Nonprofit Leadership from Rice University.

Outside the lab, Sarah can be found trying new recipes (particularly those that bring a taste of Singapore, where she is from), enjoying the ballet and symphony, and discovering new teas.
