On December 8, 2020, we held a virtual event to **showcase our partnership with policymakers** at the State of Rhode Island and our work supporting the **design and analytics** of Rhode Island's statewide COVID-19 testing program. These efforts **improved the quality and speed of information** generated to inform decisions about how to safely reopen our communities and the economy.

The event featured presentations on:
* Using design to optimize the COVID-19 testing customer experience
* Ongoing surveys to understand and monitor beliefs about COVID-19
* Predictive modeling, automation, and maintenance of COVID-19 dashboards
* The benefits of cross-sector collaboration

A special thanks to **Megan Swindal** for joining us to share the RIDOH perspective and **Jonah Popp** for showcasing the intricacies of the modeling work!
