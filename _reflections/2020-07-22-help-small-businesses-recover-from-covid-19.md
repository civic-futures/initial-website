On July 22, 2020, we hosted our first virtual event: **How can we help small and minority-owned businesses recover from COVID-19**.

We were truly grateful to have the insights and advice of the following outstanding panelists:

* **Oscar Mejias**, CEO - Rhode Island Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
* **Lisa Ranglin**, President - Rhode Island Black Business Association
* **Matt Sheaff**, Director of Stakeholder Engagement and Chief Marketing Officer - Rhode Island Commerce

The conversation focused on how small and minority-owned businesses in Rhode Island have been **affected by COVID-19**, how they've **adapted** to new public health regulations and requirements, and how Rhode Island leaders are **responding to the unique needs** of these businesses as we move to re-open our economy.
