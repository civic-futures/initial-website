Austin shared his insights from 15 years of applied research on how to **advance climate resilience for coastal infrastructure**, including:
* Communicating storm impacts to emergency managers in Rhode Island
* Perceptions of climate change amongst port administrators (globally)
* Impacts of hurricanes on port communities
* Barriers to resilience investing at northeast ports
* Vulnerability assessments undertaken by US ports

Thanks to the **Institute at Brown for Environment & Society ([IBES](https://ibes.brown.edu/))** for co-sponsoring the event with us!
